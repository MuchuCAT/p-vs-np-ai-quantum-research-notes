Thanks for reading or contributing.

## Scope
This repository is a conservative research dossier about:
- what would count as proof-level progress on P vs NP
- known proof barriers (relativization, natural proofs, algebrization)
- why common AI and quantum narratives do not meet the proof bar (today)

## Style requirements (audit-first)
1) Avoid hype and speculation.
2) Prefer short statements with explicit citations.
3) If a statement is uncertain, label it as such (e.g., "unclear; needs a primary source").

## Citation policy
- Citations use keys in square brackets: [For09]
- Every key must exist in references/bibliography.md.
- If you need a new source, add it to references/bibliography.md first.

## Claims discipline
- Strong verbs ("proves", "shows", "implies") should appear with a citation nearby.
- If a paragraph contains a strong claim without a citation, expect it to be flagged by CI (heuristic).

## Pull requests
- Keep PRs small.
- Include a short rationale and the exact claim(s) being improved.
