A structured research dossier on P vs NP and why current AI and quantum approaches do not meet the proof bar.

# P vs NP — research notes on proof barriers, AI limits, and quantum limits

This repository is a structured research dossier about the P vs NP problem.

The intent is conservative:
- clarify what would count as “progress” on P vs NP (proof-level progress)
- summarize known proof barriers (relativization, natural proofs, algebrization)
- explain why common AI/LLM narratives and quantum narratives do not meet that bar
- keep references stable and academic

Non-goals:
- proposing a proof
- claiming breakthrough results
- speculating beyond what sources support

## Structure
- classical/what_p_vs_np_requires.md — the core note (definitions + what the problem requires)
- AI/limitations_of_AI.md — why current AI methods do not directly address the proof requirement
- quantum/quantum_and_PvNP.md — what quantum computing changes (and what it does not)
- references/bibliography.md — authoritative sources (textbooks, surveys, core papers)

## Status
Draft notes, iterated slowly. I prefer small commits and explicit scope.
