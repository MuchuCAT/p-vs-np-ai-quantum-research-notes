# P vs NP — proof barriers, and limits of AI and quantum narratives

This repository is a conservative research dossier about the P vs NP problem.

The goal is not to propose a proof.
The goal is to clarify the *proof bar*:
- what would count as progress on P vs NP (proof-level progress)
- why three barrier results (relativization, natural proofs, algebrization) constrain many approaches
- why common AI/LLM and quantum-computing narratives do not meet that bar (today)

## How to read
1) `classical/what_p_vs_np_requires.md` (core note)
2) `classical/known_barriers.md` (the three barriers, audit-friendly)
3) `quantum/quantum_and_PvNP.md` (what quantum changes / does not change)
4) `AI/limitations_of_AI.md` (AI assistance vs proof artifacts)
5) `references/bibliography.md` (curated, high-authority references)

## Scope and non-goals
**In scope**
- standard definitions (P, NP, NP-complete, reductions)
- proof barriers and what they rule out
- selected lower-bound results for restricted circuit classes
- conservative discussion of AI tools for formalization and theorem proving
- conservative discussion of quantum complexity (BQP, oracle evidence)

**Out of scope**
- proof sketches for P = NP or P ≠ NP
- claims of breakthroughs
- speculative “future AI will solve it” narratives

## Citation style
In-text citations use stable keys like `[BGS75]`. See `references/bibliography.md`.

## Status
This is an evolving dossier. I prefer small commits and explicit scope.
