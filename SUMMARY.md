# Summary (v0.1)

This repository is a conservative dossier about P vs NP and three proof barriers.

## What is safe to cite (v0.1)
- P vs NP is a worst-case class separation/equality question. `[Sip12]`
- SAT is NP-complete and central via reductions. `[Coo71] [Kar72] [GJ79]`
- Relativization, natural proofs, and algebrization are formal barriers for broad technique families. `[BGS75] [RR94] [AW09]`
- Strong lower bounds exist for restricted circuit classes (AC0, ACC0), but not for general circuits. `[Has86] [Wil11]`
- Known quantum algorithms (Shor, Grover) do not imply NP-complete problems are in BQP; oracle evidence cautions against naive containments. `[Sho97] [Gro97] [RT22]`

## What is explicitly not claimed
- Any proof of P = NP or P ≠ NP.
- Any claim that AI or quantum computing cannot contribute to theory in the future.
- Any forecast of timelines.
