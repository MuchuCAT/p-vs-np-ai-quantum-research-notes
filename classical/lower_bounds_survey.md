# Lower bounds: why they matter for P vs NP (mini-survey)

## Goal
Explain what “lower bounds” mean in complexity theory and why proving P ≠ NP
is tightly connected to proving strong lower bounds.

## Outline
- Decision problems vs circuit models
- Known lower bounds for restricted models (e.g., AC0)
- Why extending them to general circuits is hard
- Where natural proofs fits into this picture

## Status
Placeholder note. Intended to stay short and reference authoritative surveys.
